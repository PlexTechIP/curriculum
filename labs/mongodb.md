# MongoDB Introduction

This lab builds on the Flask Intro project. You'll integrate a MongoDB database into your Flask application to persist data across requests.

---

## Coming Soon

Details for this lab will be posted ahead of the March 2nd session. Check back here or watch the [#announcements](#) channel for updates.

In the meantime, make sure your Flask Intro project is complete and working — this lab builds directly on top of it.

---

## What to Expect

- Connecting Flask to a MongoDB database using **PyMongo**
- Performing **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Storing and retrieving data from your budget/counter app
- Introduction to **NoSQL** document structure vs. relational tables

---

## Pre-Lab Prep

1. Make sure your Flask Intro project is pushed and working
2. Install MongoDB locally or sign up for a free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cluster
3. Read the [PyMongo quickstart](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html)
